                    SDG 1 aims to eradicate every form of extreme poverty including the lack of food, clean drinking water, and sanitation.
                    Achieving this goal includes finding solutions to new threats caused by climate change and conflict. SDG 1 focuses not
                    just on people living in poverty, but also on the services people rely on and social policy that either promotes or 
                    prevents poverty.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    The goal has seven targets and 13 indicators to measure progress. The five outcome targets are: eradication of 
                    extreme poverty; reduction of all poverty by half; implementation of social protection systems; ensuring equal rights to 
                    ownership, basic services, technology and economic resources; and the building of resilience to environmental, economic 
                    and social disasters. The two targets related to means of implementation SDG 1 are mobilization of resources to end 
                    poverty; and the establishment of poverty eradication policy frameworks at all levels.<br>
                    Despite the ongoing progress, 10 percent of the world's population live in poverty and struggle to meet basic needs 
                    such as health, education, and access to water and sanitation.Extreme poverty remains prevalent in low-income countries,
                    particularly those affected by conflict and political upheaval.In 2015, more than half of the world's 736 million people
                    living in extreme poverty lived in Sub-Saharan Africa.[8] The rural poverty rate stands at 17.2 percent and 5.3 percent in 
                    urban areas (in 2016).

This goal, known as "shared prosperity", complements SDG 1, the eradication of extreme poverty, and it is relevant for all countries in the world. There has been growth in income for poorer people in 2012–2017. Nevertheless, in many countries, "the bottom 40 per cent of the population receive less than 25 per cent of the overall income".

                    A UN report from 2020 pointed out that "women are more likely to be victims of discrimination than men". And the situation is even worse for women with disabilities. Inequality exists in various forms, such as economic, sex, disability, race, social inequality, and different forms of discrimination. Measuring inequality in its individual forms is a crucial component in order to reduce inequality within and among countries. The Gini coefficient is the most frequently used measurement of socioeconomic inequality as it can significantly show the income and wealth distribution within and among countries.

                    Issues associated with health, pollution, and environmental justice are often inseparable from inequality. Sometimes these issues are also associated with indigenous and aboriginal communities, ethnic minorities, and communities of low socioeconomic status (SES). Studies of environmental justice show that these communities are irregularly likely to live in environments with a higher risk of exposure to pollution and toxic contamination, which pose long-term health and environmental threats.

                <p class="lead">
                    SDG 12, titled "responsible consumption and production," is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The official wording of SDG 12 is "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns." SDG 12 is meant to ensure the good use of resources, improve energy efficiency and sustainable infrastructure, provide access to basic services, create green and decent jobs, and ensure a better quality of life for all. SDG 12 has 11 targets to be achieved by at least 2030, and progress towards the targets is measured using 13 indicators.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Sustainable Development Goal 12 has 11 targets. The first 8 are outcome targets, which are: implement the 10‑Year Framework of Programs on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns; achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources; reducing by half the per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and the reduction of food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses; achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle; reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse; encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices; promote public procurement practices that are sustainable; and ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development. The three means of implementation targets are: support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity; develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts; and remove market distortions, like fossil fuel subsidies, that encourage wasteful consumption.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    To ensure that plastic products are more sustainable, thus reducing plastic waste, changes such as decreasing usage and increasing the circularity of the plastic economy are expected to be required. An increase in domestic recycling and a reduced reliance on the global plastic waste trade are other actions that might help meet the goal.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Changes in consumption and production patterns can help promote the decoupling of economic growth and human well-being from resource use and environmental impact. They can also trigger the transformations envisaged in global commitments on biodiversity, the climate, and sustainable development in general.

                    SDG 13, is to limit and adapt to climate change. It is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The official mission statement of this goal is to "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts". SDG 13 and SDG 7 on clean energy are closely related and complementary.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    SDG 13 has five targets which are to be achieved by 2030. They cover a wide range of issues surrounding climate action. The first three targets are outcome targets: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters; integrate climate change measures into policies and planning; build knowledge and capacity to meet climate change. The remaining two targets are means of implementation targets. To implement the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and to promote mechanisms to raise capacity for planning and management. Along with each target, there are indicators that provide a method to review the overall progress of each target. The UNFCCC is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.

                    Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 °C". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    As of 2020, many countries are now implementing their national climate change adaptation plans. SDG 13 intends to take urgent action in order to combat climate change and its impacts.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) level of warming. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Reducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels. This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas-fired power plants, vastly increasing the use of wind, solar, and other types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use.

                <p class="lead">
                    The deterioration of coastal waters is increasing due to both pollution and coastal eutrophication. Similar factors contribute to climate change, negatively affecting the oceans and marine biodiversity which is slowly declining. The threat of growing algal blooms and dead zones in the oceans is alarming; in 2018 it was stated that "without concerted efforts, coastal eutrophication is expected to increase in 20% of large marine ecosystems by 2050".
